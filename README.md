# Spring2022-Hackathon

## Ronk and Marty play basketball but not basketball and not Ronk and Marty

In the 2022 Spring hackathon presented by the Web Developers Club on UW-Madison campus, Ben Wurster, Mitch Brenner, and Christopher Kennedy collaborated to make
a website where a user plays "basketball" by redirecting objects into a hoop by using their hands as portals. The purpose of the project is to create something cool
while utilizing the popular computer vision library OpenCV and Mediapipe, a toolkit with highly trained pose estimation machine learning models.

One can visit the github pages site to play a barebones online version or a game.py file is included in the repo to play the same game locally so long as the user has python along 
with opencv-python and mediapipe packages.
