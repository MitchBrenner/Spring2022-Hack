# Spring2022-Hackathon

## Ronk and Marty play basketball but not basketball and not Ronk and Marty

In the 2022 Spring hackathon presented by the Web Developers Club on UW-Madison campus, Ben Wurster, Mitch Brenner, and Christopher Kennedy collaborated to make a website where a user plays "basketball" by redirecting objects into a hoop by using their hands as portals. The purpose of the project is to create something cool while utilizing the popular computer vision library OpenCV and Mediapipe, a toolkit with highly trained pose estimation machine learning models.

One can visit the github pages site to play a barebones online version or a <code>game.py</code> file is included in the repo to play the same game locally so long as the user has python along with <code>opencv-python</code> and <code>mediapipe</code> packages.
