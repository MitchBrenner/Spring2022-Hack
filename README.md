# Spring2022-Hackathon

##Ronk and Marty play basketball but not basketball and not Ronk and Marty

In the 2022 Spring hackathon presented by the Web Developers Club on UW-Madison campus, Ben Wurster, Mitch Brenner, and Christopher Kennedy collaborated to make
a website where a user plays "basketball" by redirecting objects into a hoop by using their hands as portals. The purpose of the project is to create something cool
while learning OpenCV and Mediapipe.
